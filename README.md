Gives Info About My Journey

I had already learned some Python so I am writing projects I enjoy and also learn new material.

Day 1: 6/11/2024
Project:  Teach adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of fractions. 
Name: TeachFractions
Notes:  This doesn't just do the computations but explains how to do it as if it is teaching a student.
This can be a valuable teaching tool for students.
Finished seperating all the tokens.  a b/c operator d e/f - allows for a and d to be 0 so can handle any fractions.

Day 2: 6/12/2024
Projec:  Implement Sheldon's Rock, Paper, Scissors Lizard, Spock Game
Name: Sheldon Game RPSLS
