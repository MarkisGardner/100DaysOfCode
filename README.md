Gives Info About My Journey

I had already learned some Python so I am writing projects I enjoy and also learn new material.

<h2>Day 1: 6/11/2024</h2>
<h4>Project:  Teach adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of fractions.</h4> 
Name: TeachFractions</p>
Notes:  This doesn't just do the computations but explains how to do it as if it is teaching a student.</p>
This can be a valuable teaching tool for students.</p>
Finished seperating all the tokens.  a b/c operator d e/f - allows for a and d to be 0 so can handle any fractions.</p>

<h2>Day 2: 6/12/2024</h2>
<h4>Project:  Implement Sheldon's Rock, Paper, Scissors Lizard, Spock Game</h4>h4>
Name: Sheldon Game RPSLS</p>
This not only implements Sheldon's version of Rock, Paper, Scissors but gives a total of how many wins, losses and ties you have.</p>

<h2>Day 3: 6/13/2024</h2>
<h4>Project:  Implement Sheldon's Rock, Paper, Scissors Lizard, Spock Game</h4>h4>
Name: Sheldon Game RPSLS</p>
This not only implements Sheldon's version of Rock, Paper, Scissors but gives a total of how many wins, losses and ties you have.</p>
The game is now finished.  https://github.com/MarkisGardner/SheldonsGame </p>
I will make another one that does not use a bunch of if/elif/else statements.</p>

<h4>Project:  Implement Sheldon's Rock, Paper, Scissors Lizard, Spock Game - a better version</h4>
Name: Sheldon Game RPSLS - better</p>
This not only implements Sheldon's version of Rock, Paper, Scissors but gives a total of how many wins, losses and ties you have.</p>
This version does it without a long list of if/elif/elses - uses only lists.</p>

<h2>Day 4: 6/14/2024</h2>
<h4>Project:  Implement Sheldon's Rock, Paper, Scissors Lizard, Spock Game - better version</h4>
Name: Sheldon Game RPSLS</p>
This not only implements Sheldon's version of Rock, Paper, Scissors but gives a total of how many wins, losses and ties you have.</p>
This version does it without a long list of if/elif/elses - uses only lists.</p>
The game is now finished.  https://github.com/MarkisGardner/SheldonsGame-Better</p>

I did a lot of work on multiplying fractions.  Plus division of fractions is done, because I just made it flip and turned it into a multiplication problem.</p>
There is a lot of work that goes into this when you have to explain the process step by step.  Of course, the program would be easy if I just had it do the operations.</p>
But, I am a teacher by trade so I am explaining all the steps step by step.  A very tedious job.  Here is a small example:</p>
Lets say I want to multiply 9 by 20/6.  Of course the answer is 30.  But, what I am doing is explaining that first you want to reduce the 20/6 by finding the greatest common factor of 20 and 6.
That of course is 2.  So, we get 10/3 when we divide both 20 and 6 by 2.  So, now we have 9 * 10/3.  Next we see that 3 is the greatest common factor between 9 and 3.  So we can divide them both by 3.  So, we get 3 * 10/1.  Which of course is 30.</p>
